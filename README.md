 Logistic  Regression
1. Importing Libraries
Your imports cover all the essentials for data exploration, visualization, preprocessing, and classification.

2. Reading and Exploring the Dataset
Data Overview: printing the dataset shape, checking the target distribution (loan_status), and examining summary statistics.
Correlation Analysis: A heatmap of correlations is a great approach to detect relationships between variables.I noticed a strong correlation between loan_amnt and installment, and dropping installment was a good decision to avoid multicollinearity.
3. Data Cleaning and Transformation
Target Variable Mapping: Mapped loan_status values to binary (0 for "Fully Paid", 1 for "Charged Off").
Date Parsing: Converting issue_d and earliest_cr_line to datetime format is helpful for further time-based analysis.
Employment Length: Dropping emp_length is fine for simplicity if it’s not central to your analysis.
Handling Nulls: The method  used with fill_mort_acc to impute missing values for mort_acc based on total_acc is clever and maintains the data’s integrity.
4. Outlier Detection and Treatment
Boxplots: Visualizing each numerical column with boxplots is a helpful way to spot outliers.
Outlier Filtering: Removing rows with values outside three standard deviations is effective for controlling extreme values, though we could consider more sophisticated approaches like quantile-based capping if this removes too much data.
5. Data Encoding
Categorical Encoding: Converting categorical variables to one-hot encoded columns is essential, and it’s good to use drop_first=True to avoid the dummy variable trap.
6. Model Preparation
Feature Scaling: Using MinMaxScaler to scale features before model training can improve model performance by ensuring all features are on a similar scale.
7. Model Building (Logistic Regression)
Logistic Regression is a solid starting model.
